== Steps

=== Pipeline defined in YAML file

Creates and execute a pipeline defined in YAML file.
Currently only creates stages wrappen in `try/catch` blocks and run existing jobs in parallel in each stage.

```yaml
---
# list of stages
stages:
    - name: stage1
      jobs:
        - name: job1
        - name: job2
    - name: stage2-params
      jobs:
        - name: job3
          parameters:
            param1: value1
	    param2: value2
    - name: stage3
      jobs:
        - name: job4
        - name: job5
...

```
